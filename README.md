## 🚀 Projects That Define Me

- **🧬 Parkinson’s Disease Prediction**  
  Used vocal biomarkers to predict `total_UPDRS` using models like Logistic Regression, Ridge, Random Forest, SVM, Lasso, ElasticNet, ANN, and LSTM  
  🔗 [GitHub](https://github.com/Ishugit21/Parkinsons-Disease-Prediction)

- **🗣️ Mental Health NLP**  
  Classified text from Reddit and therapy platforms using DistilBERT and MiniLM. Addressed class imbalance with SMOTE and applied LDA for topic modeling  
  🔗 [GitHub](https://github.com/Ishugit21/Sentiment-Analysis)

- **🎓 Student Engagement Estimation**  
  Built a CNN + FER pipeline on the DAiSEE dataset to detect real-time engagement using facial cues. Used FaceNet and OpenCV for preprocessing  
  🔗 [GitHub](https://github.com/Ishugit21/Student-Engagement-Prediction)

- **🚗 Object & Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving**  
  Used YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 on the Waymo dataset to detect known and anomalous objects. Included confidence-based anomaly logic  
  🔗 [GitHub](https://github.com/Ishugit21/Objection-detection-and-tracking)

- **🧪 Active Feature Elicitation in Healthcare**  
  Developed an AFE framework to minimize feature acquisition cost in datasets like PIMA, Breast Cancer, and COVID-19 X-rays  
  🔗 [GitHub](https://github.com/Ishugit21/Active-Feature-Elicitation)

- **🚦 Traffic Flow Prediction from Video**  
  Combined YOLOv5 + Mask R-CNN + DeepSORT for vehicle tracking, and used TCGCN for traffic prediction. Simulated synthetic rain to test weather robustness
